## How to play with the App

After the app bootstraps and the first screen is shown, you´ll notice that it has the essence of Instagram News Feed page.
You can scroll down to see all the test posts that I´ve made and click on the "Like" button to see it summing up in real time.
The top-right icon routes you to another page where you can create a new post by uploading a random image and giving it some information.

You can see your new post on the news feed page.# chosun_feed
